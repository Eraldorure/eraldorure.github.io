Hello, so there's nothing much to say here except that this is a GitHub Pages project (which can be found in its most recent version <a href="https://eraldorure.github.io">here</a>).

I have chosen a MIT License (even though I don't know a single thing a bout licensing in general), all the terms and conditions are in there.

Okay bye now and have a nice day
